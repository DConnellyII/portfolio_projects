--Import Data to Tableau
* Drag the Excel file for the Seattle AirBnB data into Tableau
* Select the worksheets to be worked with (In this case, I'll use the Listing and Calendar worksheets from Excel)
* Join the to worksheets together Listings.Id = Calendar.Listingid
* Filter the year to 2016 to focus on 1 year of data



--Create Tableau Dashboard
* First I want to visualize the average price of an AirBnB in the different zipcodes
* Drag Zipcode from Listings into the columns section
* Drag Price from Calendars into the rows section
* Make sure to change the Price aggregation from SUM to AVG
* For ease of use, sort the Zipcode data by Field Data descending to get the prices in average price order
* For ease of use, drag Zipcode from Listings to the color section in Marks to differenciate the zipcodes
